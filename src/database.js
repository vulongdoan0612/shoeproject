The original is considered the ‘large’, with a ‘medium’ version now available which is halfway between the Ladies handbag and the large Kara in size. Please see photos above for comparisons.\n\nZips can be added to the bag for $70. Please contact us if you wish for this option as it becomes a custom order.\n\nPlease note that we use vegetable-tanned leather for this bag which differs to the consistent smooth finish that you find in most commercial bags. The bag will naturally have character and slight imperfections on the leather which we embrace. The bags once made can be stiff until they are used and worn in where it becomes more buttery in feel. Please allow time for this to develop with this natural material.\n\nPlease note that all our goods are made-to-order unless stock already exists in our shop in Melbourne. Lead times can be found in our footer below for leather goods and footwear.",

      "A traditional all-leather briefcase available in both 13” and 15” sizes to suit the appropriate device. Features two gussets to separate paperwork from devices, and a small back pocket accessed also from a zip at the back. Made in Australian bovine leather with Italian leather contrast strapping. Shoulder strap included and the lid closes using pouch studs to keep the silhouette simple and classic.\n\nThe 15″ includes a pen pocket between the front panels as well as two small pockets, whereas the 13″ only has the two pockets and no pen holder.\n\nPlease note variations in leather colour occur naturally between hide to hide. This is most prominent in the dark brown colour, which can be darker, like a bitter chocolate brown/black. The leather we use for our bags is vegetable-tanned leather, which differs to the consistent smooth finish that you find in most commercial bags. The bag will naturally have character and slight imperfections on the leather which we embrace. The bags once made can be stiff until they are used and worn in where it becomes more buttery in feel.\n\nPlease note that all our goods are made-to-order unless stock already exists in our shop in Melbourne.
